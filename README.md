# Recast.AI starter kit NodeJS

A starter kit for developing bots on the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) platform.

> **Note:** This project is currently in beta version and can be modified at any time.

## Requirements

#### Node version

We recommend to use at least `node v6


#### Recast.AI account

Create an account on the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) platform and follow this [quick tutorial](https://recast.ai/gettingstarted) to create your first bot on the interface.

## Usage


#### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/treerachai/starter-NodeJS.git my-bot && cd my-bot`

using npm
`npm install`

or yarn
`yarn`


#### Create the config file

 Create a `config.js` file in the `src` directory of your project, copy/paste these lines:

```javascript
process.env.PORT = '5000'
process.env.REQUEST_TOKEN = ''
process.env.LANGUAGE = ''
// Write your own configuration here:
// ...
```

Complete the Recast.AI `process.env.REQUEST_TOKEN` and `process.env.LANGUAGE`: go to your bot page, click on the settings icon (on the right side of your screen), and copy the `request_token`.
Then, set the default language of your bot: `'en'`, `'fr'`... or leave this field empty for auto-detection language

#### Run locally

using npm `npm start`

using yarn `yarn start`

- download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- launch it: `./ngrok http 5000`
- copy the url ngrok gave and paste it in the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) interface: Go to your bot page, click on the **RUN** tab and edit your `current bot webhook`
- Chat with your bot on the channels you've configured ;)
